          <h2>The Man</h2>
          <p>
            Rob has always had a love for the ocean, travel and endurance
            events. He is an accomplished scuba diver, having passed his PADI
            scuba dive instructor course at 18 and going on to complete a number
            of technical diving qualifications. Rob’s curiosity about the world
            and how far he can push himself led him to travel to over 40
            countries, complete two ultra-mountain marathons and, in 2016, Rob
            achieved a lifelong ambition and was accepted into the Royal
            Military Academy Sandhurst. However, soon after he started training,
            he severely injured his knee and was medically discharged.
            <br /><br />
            While taking part in the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge has been
            a goal for over 10 years; it is now also a chance for Rob to prove
            to himself that, despite his medical discharge he is capable of
            doing incredible things. The Atlantic row also presents a tremendous
            opportunity to raise money for an organisation which means a lot to
            Rob. At the start of 2018, Rob spent several months working for the
            Collateral Repair Project (CRP) in Amman, Jordan. The organisation
            helps refugees through emergency aid and community programmes such
            as English classes, after-school clubs and psycho-social support.
            Rob is hoping to raise at least £10,000 for this amazing
            organisation.

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <div class="content">
            <p>
              The Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge is often touted as one of
              the world’s toughest race, and with good reason. The annual race
              starts ever December in the Canary Islands and finishes 3000 miles
              later, in Antigua. During the race Rob will have to contend with
              seasickness, salt sores, sleep deprivation, dehydration, extreme
              heat, isolation, 20ft high waves, sharks, and possible capsizes.
              Despite eating over 6000 calories a day, Rob will likely lose at
              least 12kg by the time he finishes in Antigua. It is perhaps
              unsurprising that more people have climbed Everest than
              successfully rowed across an ocean.<br /><br />
              While there are two safety yachts for the fleet in case of
              emergencies, the race itself is unsupported. Rob will carry
              everything he needs to cross the Atlantic in his boat, this
              includes enough food for 90 days, a water maker to purify sea
              water, a satellite phone, life raft, radio and chart plotter. Rob
              is actively seeking sponsorship to help him achieve this
              incredible goal. Please download a sponsorship document if you
              would like more information.

          <h2>The Charity</h2>
          <p>
            Rob is hoping to raise £10,000 for Collateral Repair Project (CRP),
            a refugee support organisation based in Amman, Jordan. The
            organisation supports refugees from Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Yemen
            as well as poorer Jordanians through emergency aid and community
            programming such as English classes, after-school clubs, trauma
            relief and women’s empowerment groups. The organisation has special
            meaning to Rob as he worked there for several months in 2018,
            helping to manage volunteers who ran crucial programmes.
            <br /><br />
            CRP fosters community and dignity in refugee neighbourhoods, as well
            as ensuring that basic food and housing needs are met. They provide
            basic-needs assistance to hundreds of families through in-kind aid,
            information and referral services, and a monthly food-voucher
            program that provides eligible households with coupons to purchase
            fresh produce and groceries. CRP’s Family Resource and Community
            Centre offers many activities and learning opportunities to allow
            refugees to begin to rebuild the communities they lost after fleeing
            their home countries.<br /><br />
            CRP’s strengths include a wealth of knowledge about the refugee
            community in East Amman and strong relationships with the
            beneficiaries we serve. The community centre is a place where many
            refugees spend their days. Because of this, CRP has cultivated
            strong grassroots support from beneficiaries, many of whom go on to
            become volunteers, helping to assist their neighbours to access
            programs and services. CRP also has built relationships with several
            partner organizations who join us in our mission. If you are
            interested in donating towards this amazing organisation please
