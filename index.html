              Atlantic Titan is made up of one person, Rob Hamilton. Rob has
              always had a love for the ocean, travel and endurance events. He
              is an accomplished scuba diver, having passed his PADI scuba dive
              instructor course at 18 and going on to complete a number of
              technical diving qualifications. Rob’s curiosity about the world
              and how far he can push himself led him to travel to over 40
              countries, complete two ultra-mountain marathons and, in 2016, Rob
              achieved a lifelong ambition and was accepted into the Royal
              Military Academy Sandhurst. However, soon after he started
              training, he severely injured his knee and was medically
              discharged.
              <br /><br />
              While taking part in the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge has
              been a goal for over 10 years; it is now also a chance for Rob to
              prove to himself that, despite his medical discharge he is capable
              of doing incredible things. The Atlantic row also presents a
              tremendous opportunity to raise money for an organisation which
              means a lot to Rob. At the start of 2018, Rob spent several months
              working for the Collateral Repair Project (CRP) in Amman, Jordan.
              The organisation helps refugees through emergency aid and
              community programmes such as English classes, after-school clubs
              and psycho-social support. Rob is hoping to raise at least £10,000
              for this amazing organisation.

            <p>
              The Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge is often touted as one of
              the world’s toughest races, and with good reason. The annual race
              starts ever December in the Canary Islands and finishes 3000 miles
              later, in Antigua. During the race Rob will have to contend with
              seasickness, salt sores, sleep deprivation, dehydration, extreme
              heat, isolation, 30ft high waves, sharks, and possible capsizes.
              Despite eating over 6000 calories a day, Rob will likely lose at
              least 12kg by the time he finishes in Antigua. It is perhaps
              unsurprising that more people have climbed Everest than
              successfully rowed across an ocean.<br /><br />
              While there are two safety yachts for the fleet in case of
              emergencies, the race itself is unsupported. Rob will carry
              everything he needs to cross the Atlantic in his boat, this
              includes enough food for 90 days, a water maker to purify sea
              water, a satellite phone, life raft, radio and chart plotter. Rob
              is actively seeking sponsorship to help him achieve this
              incredible goal. Please download a sponsorship document if you
              would like more information.

              Rob is hoping to raise £10,000 for Collateral Repair Project
              (CRP), a refugee support organisation based in Amman, Jordan. The
              organisation supports refugees from Sudan, Syria, Iraq, Somalia
              and Yemen as well as poorer Jordanians through emergency aid and
              community programming such as English classes, after-school clubs,
              trauma relief and women’s empowerment groups. The organisation has
              special meaning to Rob as he worked there for several months in
              2018, helping to manage volunteers who ran crucial programmes.
              <br /><br />
              CRP fosters community and dignity in refugee neighbourhoods, as
              well as ensuring that basic food and housing needs are met. They
              provide basic-needs assistance to hundreds of families through
              in-kind aid, information and referral services, and a monthly
              food-voucher program that provides eligible households with
              coupons to purchase fresh produce and groceries. CRP’s Family
              Resource and Community Centre offers many activities and learning
              opportunities to allow refugees to begin to rebuild the
              communities they lost after fleeing their home countries. If you
              are interested in donating towards this amazing organisation
