                Atlantic Titan is made up of just me, Rob Hamilton. I have
                always had a love for the ocean, travel and endurance events. I
                am an experienced scuba diver having passed my PADI scuba dive
                instructor course at 18 and going on to complete a number of
                technical diving qualifications. My curiosity about the world
                and how far I can push myself led me to complete a master’s in
                Near and Middle Eastern Studies, travel to nearly 50 countries
                and complete two ultra-mountain marathons. In 2016, I achieved a
                lifelong ambition when I was accepted into the Royal Military
                Academy Sandhurst. However, soon after I started training, I
                severely injured my knee and I was medically discharged.
                <br />
                <br />
                While taking part in the Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge has
                been a goal of mine for over 10 years; it is now also a chance
                to prove to myself that, despite my medical discharge I am
                capable of doing incredible things. The Atlantic row also
                presents a tremendous opportunity to raise money for an
                organisation which means a lot to me. At the start of 2018, I
                spent several months working for the Collateral Repair Project
                (CRP) in Amman, Jordan. The organisation helps refugees through
                emergency aid and community programmes such as English classes,
                after-school clubs and psycho-social support. I am hoping to
                raise at least £15,000 for this amazing organisation.

          <div class="content-h-split">
            <p>
              The Talisker Whisky Atlantic Challenge is often touted as one of
              the world’s toughest race, and with good reason. The annual race
              starts ever December in the Canary Islands and finishes 3000 miles
              later, in Antigua. During the race I will have to contend with
              seasickness, salt sores, sleep deprivation, dehydration, extreme
              heat, isolation, 30ft high waves, sharks, and possible capsizes.
              Despite eating over 6000 calories a day, I will likely lose at
              least 12kg by the time I finish in Antigua. It is perhaps
              unsurprising that more people have climbed Everest than
              successfully rowed across an ocean.
              <br /><br />
              While there are two safety yachts for the fleet in case of
              emergencies, the race itself is unsupported. I will carry
              everything I need to cross the Atlantic in my boat, this includes
              enough food for 90 days, a water maker to purify sea water, a
              satellite phone, life raft, radio and chart plotter.
              <br /><br />
              December 2020 may seem a long way off, however, there is a huge
              amount of training and preparation to do. To assist with my
              preparations, I am actively seeking sponsorship to help achieve my
              incredible goal. Please download a sponsorship document if you
              would like more information.

              I am hoping to raise at least £15,000 for Collateral Repair
              Project (CRP), a refugee support organisation based in Amman,
              Jordan. The organisation supports refugees from Syria, Iraq,
              Sudan, Somalia and Yemen as well as poorer Jordanians through
              emergency aid and community programming such as English classes,
              after-school clubs, trauma relief and women’s empowerment groups.
              The organisation often has the feeling of a community living room
              where refugees from a variety of nations can briefly forget about
              their hardships and receive help in trying to rebuild their lives.
              CRP has a very special meaning to me as I worked there for several
              months in 2018, helping to manage volunteers who ran crucial
              programmes
              <br /><br />
              CRP fosters community and dignity in refugee neighbourhoods, as
              well as ensuring that basic food and housing needs are met. They
              provide basic-needs assistance to hundreds of families through
              in-kind aid, information and referral services, and a monthly
              food-voucher program that provides eligible households with
              coupons to purchase fresh produce and groceries. CRP’s Family
              Resource and Community Centre offers many activities and learning
              opportunities to allow refugees to begin to rebuild the
              communities they lost after fleeing their home countries..
